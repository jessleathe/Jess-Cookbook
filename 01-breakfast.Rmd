**Step 1:**
Halve the avocado vertically and remove the pit. Use a small knife to dice the avocado flesh while it's still inside the skin. Scoop the diced avocado flesh out of the skin and into a small bowl. 

**Step 2:**
Use a fork to mash the avocado until it’s as smooth as you like it. Mix in a pinch of salt and pepper (about 1/8 teaspoon each) and add more to taste, if desired. Lastly, squeeze in the lemon juice and mix thoroughly. 

**Step 3:**
Toast your slice of bread until golden and firm.

**Step 4:**
While the bread toasts cook the egg by first pouring 1 tbsp of avocado oil over low heat in a small (8-inch) non-stick skillet. Once it is hot, crack the eggs into the skillet and cook the egg until it is cooked through, about 2 to 3 minutes.

**Step 5:**
Once the toast is done, spread the avocado mash on top of each slice. Drizzle them both with avocado oil and sprinkle them with everything bagel seasoning.

**Step 6:**
Once the eggs are done, place the eggs on each of the slices and enjoy!

**Step 1:**
Set a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet in the oven and preheat to 200°F (93°C). If using very fresh, moist bread, arrange slices in a single layer on the rack and cook in oven, turning once, until lightly toasted, about 10 minutes.

**Step 2:**
Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, whisk together eggs, sugar, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla until thoroughly combined. Add milk and whisk to blend.

**Step 3:**
Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a large non-stick or cast iron skillet over medium heat, swirling skillet, until foaming subsides, about 5 minutes.

**Step 4:**
Soak 2 slices of bread in egg bath, turning, until saturated. Add soaked bread to skillet and cook, swirling occasionally, until browned on bottom side, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle top side of bread with sugar, flip, and continue to cook, swirling occasionally, until browned on second side, about 3 minutes longer.

**Step 5:**
Transfer French toast to the rack in the oven in a single layer to keep warm and repeat with remaining slices of bread and egg bath.

**Step 6:**
Serve French toast with pats of butter and maple syrup.
