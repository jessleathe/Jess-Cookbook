# Instructions on how to run my cookbook project

1. Download the folder (if the folder is zipped when downloaded, unzip it)
2. On the top right corner of R studio, click where it says "Project: (None)"
3. Choose to "Open Project"
4. Choose the downloaded, unzipped folder for this project
5. In the console, run the following commands: 
   - install.packages("bookdown")
   - install.packages("readxl")
   - install.packages("googlesheets4")
6. Once all of those are downloaded, click the build tab on the top right window of R studio.
7. Click "Build Book"
8. Your book should now compile and take a few seconds to pop up, if it says you need to download a package, use the same process and format as the ones above with whichever package it tells you you need.
